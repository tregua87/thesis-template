\todo{Introduction context of Trusted Execution Environments}
Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) refers to set of technologies that 
guarantee confidentiality and integrity of specific portion of code.
\todo{Claim the properties they achieve}
TEE are implemented at hardware level, such as at microcode for Intel 
SGX~\todo{cite}, and allows one to define isolated portion of memory in which 
executing critical piece of software and data, called \emph{enclaves}.
The \emph{enclaves} are de-fact isolated sub-systems that work parallely with, 
and isolated from, the other system components.
Historically, Open Mobile Terminal Platform (OMTP) defined the TEE security 
guarantees in \todo{cite}, and they define two level of security from attacker 
\emph{software} and \emph{hardware}.
For what concerns \emph{software} attacks, a TEE guarantees that other software 
component cannot directly read or write the \emph{enclave} memory space;
while the \emph{hardware} defense extends this protection also against manually 
tampering with the hardware itself.
Besides local protection, TEE implements Remote Attestation (RA) schemes
that allow a remote entity, called \emph{Verifier}, to verify the identify and 
integrity of a so-called \emph{Prover} (which is called \emph{enclave} in TEE 
terminology).
\todo{Few examples of applications}
Such technology have been well adopted in many scenarios that vary from Web 
applications to Digital Rights Managements (DRM) but also in embedding systems 
or crypto currencies.
\todo{Focus on a technology? Dunno...}
Moreover, the commercial competition of TEE vendors (\eg Intel or AMD) improved 
the sophistication of \emph{enclaves} and smoothed the learning curve.
As a result, nowadays it is easier to adopt TEE technologies in commercial 
products.

\todo{Focus on some of the new challenges}
The new protections introduced by TEE rose the bar for attackers, that now have 
to face new challenges.
Nonetheless, TEE technologies still suffer of many limitations in terms of 
security and scalability.
In this thesis, I will first describe modern TEE technolgies and the challenges 
that are not yet addressed (Chapter~\ref{chp:background}).
From this step, I will study the limitations of current TEE works under 
different point of view and propose mitigation to strengthen the 
\emph{enclave} security properties.
%\todo{List the stuff I am going to touch}
Overall, my study covers five TEE aspects:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \todo{Scalability code protection protection} First, I will face a 
	scalability issues that affect many modern	TEE technologies 
	(Chapter~\ref{chp:static-protection}).
	\item \todo{New threats} Then, I will investigate new type of threats that 
	may threaten \emph{enclaves} (Chapter~\ref{chp:advanced-threats}).
	\item \todo{New defenses} From this point, I will design new defenses that 
	extend the security domain of TEE and collect dynamic \emph{enclaves} 
	information (Chapter~\ref{chp:runtime-protection}).
	\item \todo{Forensic analysis} Finally, I will investigate the new 
	challenges introduced by TEE technologies in terms of memory-forensic 
	analysis (Chapter~\ref{chp:forensic}).
\end{itemize}
