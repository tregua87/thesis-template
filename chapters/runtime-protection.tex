\chapter{At the Edge of New Defenses and Analysis for Trusting Computing} % 
%Main chapter title
\label{chp:runtime-protection} 

The attack described in~\ref{chp:advanced-threats} requires a study of new
defenses and analyses. In particular, we would answer to the following 
question: \textbf{can we have evidence a program is running as intended?}

The answer to this question is addressed in three papers:
\begin{itemize}
	\item ScaRR: Scalable Runtime Remote Attestation for Complex Systems (RAID 
	2019).
	\item SgxMonitor: A Novel Runtime Remote Attestation Schema for SGX 
	Enclaves (under review).
	\item Following the evidence beyond the wall: memory forensics in SGX
	environment (under review).
\end{itemize}
