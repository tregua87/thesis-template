\chapter{Static Code Protection in Untrusted Environments}
\label{chp:static-protection} 

Here, I answer to the following question: \textbf{is a program loaded in memory 
as intended?}

The answer to this question is addressed in two papers:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Careful-Packing: A practical and scalable anti-tampering software 
	protection enforced by trusted computing (CODASPY 2019).
	\item HolA: Holistic and Autonomous Attestation for IoT Networks (under 
	review).
\end{itemize}
