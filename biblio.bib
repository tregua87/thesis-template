	abstract="We show how to leverage the RKA (Related-Key Attack) security of 
	blockciphers to provide RKA security for a suite of high-level primitives. 
	This motivates a more general theoretical question, namely, when is it 
	possible to transfer RKA security from a primitive P1 to a primitive P2? We 
	provide both positive and negative answers. What emerges is a broad and 
	high level picture of the way achievability of RKA security varies across 
	primitives, showing, in particular, that some primitives resist ``more'' 
	RKAs than others. A technical challenge was to achieve RKA security even 
	for the practical classes of related-key deriving (RKD) functions 
	underlying fault injection attacks that fail to satisfy the 
	``claw-freeness'' assumption made in previous works. We surmount this 
	barrier for the first time based on the construction of PRGs that are not 
	only RKA secure but satisfy a new notion of identity-collision-resistance.",

	flow-insensitive points-to analysis in practice. While previous 
	work has shown that such a gap may exist, no efficient 
	algorithm for precise flow-insensitive analysis is known, 
	making measurement of the gap on real-world programs difficult. 
	We give an algorithm for precise flow-insensitive analysis of 
	programs with finite memory, based on a novel technique for 
	refining any points-to analysis with a search for 
	flow-insensitive witnesses. We give a compact symbolic encoding 
	of the technique that enables computing the search using a 
	tuned SAT solver. We also present extensions of the algorithm 
	that enable computing lower and upper bounds on the precision 
	gap in the presence of dynamic memory allocation. In our 
	experimental evaluation over a suite of small- to medium-sized 
	C programs, we never observed a precision gap between 
	Andersen's analysis and the precise analysis. In other words, 
	Andersen's analysis computed a precise flow-insensitive result 
	for all of our benchmarks. Hence, we conclude that while better 
	algorithms for the precise flow-insensitive analysis are still 
	of theoretical interest, their practical impact for C programs 
	is likely to be negligible.",

	Intel SGX enclaves are vulnerable against cache-timing attacks. As 
	a case study, we present an access-driven cache-timing attack on 
	AES when running inside an Intel SGX enclave. Using Neve and 
	Seifert's elimination method, as well as a cache probing mechanism 
	relying on Intel PMC, we are able to extract the AES secret key in 
	less than 10 seconds by investigating 480 encrypted blocks on 
	average. The AES implementation we attack is based on a Gladman AES 
	implementation taken from an older version of OpenSSL, which is 
	known to be vulnerable to cache-timing attacks. In contrast to 
	previous works on cache-timing attacks, our attack is executed with 
	root privileges running on the same host as the vulnerable enclave. 
	Intel SGX, however, was designed to precisely protect applications 
	against such root-level attacks. As a consequence, we show that SGX 
	cannot withstand its designated attacker model when it comes to 
	side-channel vulnerabilities. To the contrary, the attack surface 
	for side-channels increases dramatically in the scenario of SGX due 
	to the power of root-level attackers, for example, by exploiting 
	the accuracy of PMC, which is restricted to kernel code.},

	abstract = {Intel Software Guard eXtension (SGX), a hardware supported 
	trusted execution environment (TEE), is designed to protect security 
	critical applications. However, it does not terminate traditional memory 
	corruption vulnerabilities for the software running inside enclave, since 
	enclave software is still developed with type unsafe languages such as 
	C/C++. This paper presents RUST-SGX, an efficient and layered approach to 
	exterminating memory corruption for software running inside SGX enclaves. 
	The key idea is to enable the development of enclave programs with an 
	efficient memory safe system language Rust with a RUST-SGX SDK by solving 
	the key challenges of how to (1) make the SGX software memory safe and (2) 
	meanwhile run as efficiently as with the SDK provided by Intel. We 
	therefore propose to build RUST-SGX atop Intel SGX SDK, and tame unsafe 
	components with formally proven memory safety. We have implemented RUST-SGX 
	and tested with a series of benchmark programs. Our evaluation results show 
	that RUST-SGX imposes little extra overhead (less than 5% with respect to 
	%the SGX specific features and services compared to software developed by 
	%Intel SGX SDK), and meanwhile have stronger memory safety.},

	abstract = {Side-channel risks of Intel SGX have recently attracted 
	great attention. Under the spotlight is the newly discovered 
	page-fault attack, in which an OS-level adversary induces page 
	faults to observe the page-level access patterns of a protected 
	process running in an SGX enclave. With almost all proposed defense 
	focusing on this attack, little is known about whether such efforts 
	indeed raise the bar for the adversary, whether a simple variation 
	of the attack renders all protection ineffective, not to mention an 
	in-depth understanding of other attack surfaces in the SGX system. 
	In the paper, we report the first step toward systematic analyses 
	of side-channel threats that SGX faces, focusing on the risks 
	associated with its memory management. Our research identifies 8 
	potential attack vectors, ranging from TLB to DRAM modules. More 
	importantly, we highlight the common misunderstandings about SGX 
	memory side channels, demonstrating that high frequent AEXs can be 
	avoided when recovering EdDSA secret key through a new page channel 
	and fine-grained monitoring of enclave programs (at the level of 
	64B) can be done through combining both cache and cross-enclave 
	DRAM channels. Our findings reveal the gap between the ongoing 
	security research on SGX and its side-channel weaknesses, redefine 
	the side-channel threat model for secure enclaves, and can provoke 
	a discussion on when to use such a system and how to use it 
	securely.},

	anti-tampering techniques. Both can substantially increase security, and
	yet both have limitations. In this work, we propose an approach which
	combines trusted computing technologies and anti-tampering techniques, and
	that synergistically overcomes some of their inherent limitations. In our
	approach critical software regions are protected by leveraging on trusted
	computing technologies and cryptographic packing, without introducing
	additional software layers. To illustrate our approach we implemented a
	secure monitor which collects user activities, such as keyboard and mouse
	events for insider attack detection. We show how our solution provides a
	strong anti-tampering guarantee with a low overhead: around 10 lines of
	code added to the entire application, an average execution time overhead of
	5.7% and only 300KB of memory allocated for the trusted module.},

	critical applications. However, it does not terminate traditional memory
	corruption vulnerabilities for the software running inside enclave, since
	enclave software is still developed with type unsafe languages such as
	C/C++. This paper presents RUST-SGX, an efficient and layered approach to
	exterminating memory corruption for software running inside SGX enclaves.
	The key idea is to enable the development of enclave programs with an
	efficient memory safe system language Rust with a RUST-SGX SDK by solving
	the key challenges of how to (1) make the SGX software memory safe and (2)
	meanwhile run as efficiently as with the SDK provided by Intel. We
	therefore propose to build RUST-SGX atop Intel SGX SDK, and tame unsafe
	components with formally proven memory safety. We have implemented RUST-SGX
	and tested with a series of benchmark programs. Our evaluation results show
	that RUST-SGX imposes little extra overhead (less than 5% with respect to
	%the SGX specific features and services compared to software developed by
	%Intel SGX SDK), and meanwhile have stronger memory safety.},

	abstract  = { This paper analyzes a previously overlooked attack surface
	that allows unprivileged adversaries to impact supposedly secure
	floating-point computations in Intel SGX enclaves through the Application
	Binary Interface (ABI). In a comprehensive study across 7 widely used
	industry-standard and research enclave shielding runtimes, we show that
	control and state registers of the x87 Floating-Point Unit (FPU) and Intel
	Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) are not always properly sanitized on
	enclave entry. First, we abuse the adversary’s control over precision and
	rounding modes as a novel “ABI-level fault injection” primitive to silently
	corrupt enclaved floating-point operations, enabling a new class of
	stealthy, integrity-only attacks that disturb the result of SGX enclave
	computations. Our analysis reveals that this threat is especially relevant
	for applications that use the older x87 FPU, which is still being used
	under certain conditions for high-precision operations by modern compilers
	like gcc. We exemplify the potential impact of ABI-level
	quality-degradation attacks in a case study of an enclaved machine learning
	service and in a larger analysis on the SPEC benchmark programs. Second, we
	explore the impact on enclave confidentiality by showing that the
	adversary’s control over floating-point exception masks can be abused as an
	innovative controlled channel to detect FPU usage and to recover enclaved
	multiplication operands in certain scenarios. Our findings, affecting 5 out
	of the 7 studied runtimes, demonstrate the fallacy and challenges of
	implementing high-assurance trusted execution environments on contemporary
	x86 hardware. We responsibly disclosed our findings to the vendors and were
	assigned two CVEs, leading to patches in the Intel SGX-SDK, Microsoft
	OpenEnclave, the Rust compiler’s SGX target, and Go-TEE. },
